# Plans
I plan to make this software for the (Ohio-Class) submarine to use. This project is still in development and will not be finished until around A month or so. This software has yet to come. All additional features will come out soon for the new Sonar Ping Software (SPS)

# Versions
23.4.5 will be ONE of the best sonar GUI/UI designs and MORE!.
23.4.4 was ONE of the best UI/GUI and SONAR Frequency (htz) designs/sounds.

# Notice
If you want to download and use this software, you need a REAL Sonar Pinging Machine. You can't legally own one. 
I am not legally required to upload this software, but I want to share it with you guys so you can explore and see what goes on!

# Extra
- Nothing here.
